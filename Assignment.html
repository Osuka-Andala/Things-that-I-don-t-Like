<h1 align="center"><u>Things That I hate.</u></h1>
<h3>1. <em><u>Animals</u></em></h3>
<p> I am not a fan of animals. I mean yeah, some are soft and cuddly but the fact that the are not human and cannot think like we do which would make them understand that I dont like them therefore keep away from me is what pisses me off most. Especially cats. They some attention seeking non-ninjas.I do like Siberian Huskies though. They are pretty cool. That's a dog I would keep.</p>
<h3>2. <em><u>'Right of way' drivers.</u></em></h3>
<p>I get it, you are driving and I am walking. That does not make you better than me. I will take my time at a zebra rossing and a green pedestrian light and don't you dare hppt at me. That is my lane. I will not jump off the side walk for you just because you don't want your car to wade in a puddle. I don't want to do that either so let us please respect each other.</p>
<h3>3. <em><u>'Holier than thou' attitude.</u></em></h3>
<p>Let us just say that when the trumpets sound, that is if the ever do, we shall all be judged accordingly and it will not be by you.</p>
<h3>4. <em><u>Bicycles.</u></em></h3>
<p>I cannot ride one. I am afraid of being on one. The idea that I have to control everything, balance, the chain might break, the breaks might fail, cars are bigger... My body cannot handle that kind of presure. Two wheels, no engine? Thanks, but no thanks. I am good just walking.</p>
<h3>5. <em><u>Badam Kesar Ice cream.</u></em></h3>
<p>One question, WHY??? That stuff is really disgusting. Why wouild ice ceam taste like that. Ice cream should NEVER taste like that. That is illegal. I think. Or maybe the one I had was just bad. But still, not cool.</p>
